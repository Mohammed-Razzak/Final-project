# final-project

- This is a fitness based web application called PlanFit which aims to provide an all-encompassing guide for those interested in fitness and are looking to get started
- This application will cover three main goals which are losing weight, gaining weight, and building muscle
- This application aims to cover a wide range of individuals who want to get started as most fitness applications only provide guidance on losing weight but not gaining weight as some people struggle with gaining weight 
- The building muscle category will aim to provide a guide for those looking to build muscle with intense workouts and strict diet plans
- The application will also recommend books on mental health as there is evidence that working out and getting healthy can have a positive impact on a persons mental health and wellbeing
